# Placeholder files for PWA icons

These files are placeholders for the PWA icons. In a production app, you would replace these with actual icon files.

- icon-192x192.png - 192x192 pixel app icon
- icon-512x512.png - 512x512 pixel app icon

For now, these are referenced in the manifest.json but the actual files need to be created or generated.
